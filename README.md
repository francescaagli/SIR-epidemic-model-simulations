# SIR epidemic model simulations

## Project description
In this project I simulated the spread of an epidemic using the SIR model. The population is divided into Susceptible, Infected and Recovered individuals. The system of differential equations was solved numerically using a fourth order Runge-Kutta integrator (RK4). I then performed a sensitivity analysis varying the infection rate beta and the recovery rate gamma, first separately and then simultaneously.
